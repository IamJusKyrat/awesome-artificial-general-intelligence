To contribute more resources just fork the repository, make the changes on the fork and then submit a pull request, see:

* https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/
* https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962

It is important that the resources you add are highly AGI specific and not just any AI / DS / ML type resources.
